## Research Overview

My research focuses on **III–V semiconductor epitaxy using MBE**, with an emphasis on quantum dots, nanostructures, and materials for quantum photonics. I am interested in how **growth physics, interface quality, and strain engineering** translate into device-relevant properties such as linewidth, brightness, wavelength control, and stability.  

The main systems I currently work with are **InAs/GaAs** and **GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots**, together with supporting heterostructures for integrated quantum photonic devices.

## InAs/GaAs Quantum Dots for Quantum Photonics

My research on **InAs/GaAs quantum dots** focuses on developing highly controlled nanostructures for single-photon and entangled-photon applications. Using molecular beam epitaxy, I work on understanding and engineering the **nucleation, strain profiles, intermixing, and interface chemistry** that determine emission wavelength, excitonic properties, and linewidth stability. This includes optimising growth windows, tuning dot density, controlling QD–QD coupling in quantum-dot molecules, and refining heterostructures through wavefunction engineering.  

The aim is to combine **optically clean emission**, **high reproducibility**, and **scalable integration**, enabling quantum dots that can be used reliably in quantum communication, chip-scale photonics, and future quantum repeaters.

## GaAs/AlGaAs Quantum Dots via Local Droplet Epitaxy / Droplet Etching

I also work on **GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots grown via Local Droplet Epitaxy (LDE) and Local Droplet Etching (LDEt)**—a strain-free platform that enables exceptionally symmetric, low-fine-structure-splitting quantum emitters. My work focuses on controlling droplet formation, nanohole morphology, infilling kinetics, anisotropy, and AlGaAs interface quality to achieve **narrow optical linewidths**, site-controlled positioning, and wavelength-tunable emission.  

By systematically linking AFM, XRD, PL, and growth-parameter datasets, I aim to establish robust, device-ready GaAs QDs suited for quantum photonic circuits, resonator-coupled emitters, integrated quantum light sources, and high-yield scalable fabrication.
