![Hiking in the Peak District](/assets/img/out-of-hours-hike.jpg){: .img-fluid .rounded }

I spend a lot of my “out of hours” time walking into hills, moorland, and slightly questionable weather. Hiking in wide, quiet landscapes is a refreshing counterbalance to staring at RHEED screens, XRD curves and PL spectra — it’s where I reset, clear my mind, and reconnect with things outside work.  

This page will collect small notes, photos, and reflections from nature, travel, and other non-lab parts of life.
