Akshay K. Verma is a semiconductor materials researcher specialising in
**III–V epitaxy using MBE**, with a focus on **quantum dots** and **quantum
photonics**.

His work centres on:

- Growth of high-quality GaAs, AlGaAs, GaSb and InGaAs nanostructures by MBE  
- Local Droplet Epitaxy / Local Droplet Etching for site-controlled quantum dots  
- Optimising optical linewidths and device-relevant properties for quantum
  technologies

At the moment, Akshay is a Research Associate at the
**University of Sheffield (UK)**, working on epitaxial growth and
characterisation for quantum photonic devices.

Outside the cleanroom, he is interested in:

- Translating epitaxy know-how into real devices and products  
- Building collaborations between academia, industry and national facilities  
- Learning more about chip design, device physics and quantum information
