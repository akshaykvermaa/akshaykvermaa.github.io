# Professional Summary

I am a semiconductor materials scientist specialising in **III–V epitaxy using MBE**, with a focus on **quantum dots, nanostructures, and quantum photonic materials**. I have delivered high-quality epitaxial wafers for research, industry, and national facilities, combining deep materials science expertise with hands-on reactor operation and data-driven optimisation. My work spans growth development, interface engineering, device-oriented characterisation, and cross-functional collaboration, with a strong interest in translating epitaxial processes into **scalable, device-ready technologies**.
